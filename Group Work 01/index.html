      <strong>Web development</strong> is the work involved in developing a
      website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private
      network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static
      page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
      social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
      development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
      content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
      Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
      Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
      non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web
      development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
      changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger
      organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of
      hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile
      methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only
      require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
      assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
      information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative
      effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
      department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
      front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
      Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in
      the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since
      the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become
      one of the most used technologies ever.

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2><strong>Origin/ Web 1.0</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN. The primary
      goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated
      information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and
      various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.
      Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view
      material and provide a small amount of information. Core protocols of web
      1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2><strong>Web 2.0</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of
      O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in
      internet usage, emphasizing interactivity. Web 2.0 introduced increased
      user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only
      nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and
      communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, read-write
      online network. In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have
      access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating
      music, files, images, and movies. The architecture of Web 2.0 is often
      considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized XML
      (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from
      independent platforms and online databases.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2><strong>Web 3.0</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was
      introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web.
      Key features include the integration of metadata, precise information
      delivery, and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and
      interests.[citation needed] Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable,
      organized database, providing more functionality than traditional search
      engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and
      the core ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for
      efficiency, and creating user profiles. This version is sometimes also
      known as Semantic Web.

    <h2><strong>Evolution of web development technologies</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The journey of web development technologies began with simple HTML pages
      in the early days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the
      incorporation of CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. This
      evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive
      platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web
      applications we have today.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Web development in future will be driven by advances in browser
      technology, Web internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software
      engineering methods, and application trends.
