      <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup
      language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
      defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of
      HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
      interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a
      means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
      text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
      HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
      such as <u>img</u> and <u>input</u> directly introduce content into the
      page. Other tags such as <u>p</u> and <u>p</u> surround and provide
      information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers
      do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the
      page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
      JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
      inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer
      of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
      presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to
      display video and audio, primarily using the <u>canvas</u> element,
      together with JavaScript.

    <h2><strong>Development</strong></h2>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
      prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
      documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
      hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
      server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
      the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of
      1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is
      used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry. The first publicly available
      description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
      the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements
      comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the
      hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house
      Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at
      CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4. HTML is a markup
      language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and
      other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics
      for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these
      characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's
      additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988
      ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes
      the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the
      RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible
      Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were
      derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format
      documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on
      elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely
      print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
      progressively moved in this direction with CSS. Berners-Lee considered
      HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
      Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of
      the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
      Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which
      included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax. The draft
      expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the
      NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting
      the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.
      Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext
      Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
      already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms. After the
      HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML
      Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first
      HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which
      future implementations should be based. Further development under the
      auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the
      HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial
      software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In 2000, HTML
      became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
      published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In
      2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application
      Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with
      the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.

      HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called
      tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character
      references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs
      like <u>h1</u> and <u>h1</u>, although some represent empty elements and
      so are unpaired, for example <u>img</u>. The first tag in such a pair is
      the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
      tags and closing tags).

    <p>
      HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are
      indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      .[better source needed] In the simple, general case, the extent of an
      element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
    </p>

    <p>and "end tag"</p>
    . The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
    Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end,
    including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested)
    elements, as children of the parent element. The start tag may also include
    the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information,
    such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to
    bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some
    tags such as the <u>img</u> used to embed images, the reference to the image
    resource in the format like this: <u>img src="example.com/example.jpg"</u>

    Some elements, such as the line break <br />
    do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These
    require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end
    tag. Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used
    paragraph element
    <p>
      , are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for
      the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by
      the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by
      most HTML authors. The general form of an HTML element is therefore:
      <u>tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"''content''/tag</u>. Some
      HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form
      <u>tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"</u>. Empty elements may
      enclose no content, for instance, the <u>br /</u> tag or the inline
      <u>img</u> tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags.
      The end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, /, and that in empty
      elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are
      not mentioned, default values are used in each case.

      HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data
      and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values,
      including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media
      descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All
      of these data types are specializations of character data. Document type
      declaration HTML documents are required to start with a Document type
      declaration (informally, a "doctype"). In browsers, the doctype helps to
      define the rendering mode—particularly whether to use quirks mode. The
      original purpose of the doctype was to enable the parsing and validation
      of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the Document type definition
      (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable
      grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document
      conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement
      HTML as an application of SGML and as consequence do not read the DTD.

    <h2><strong>Semantic HTML</strong></h2>

    <hr />
    <p>
      Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the
      encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included
      semantic markup from its inception, but has also included
      presentational markup, such as <i>font</i>, <u>i</u> and
      <u>center</u> tags. There are also the semantically neutral div and span
      tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to
      work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use
      of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content and
      presentation. In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee
      and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents"
      may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate
      previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users. Such
      agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0,
      mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main
      difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's
      semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and
      hybridization of information is usually designed by web developers, who
      already know the web locations and the API semantics of the specific data
      they wish to mash, compare and combine. An important type of web agent
      that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge
      of what it might find, is the web crawler or search-engine spider. These
      software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they
      find as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index
      millions of web pages a day and provide web users with search facilities
      without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced. In
      order for search engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of
      pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating
      mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are
      developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely
      and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of the published text.
      Presentational markup tags are deprecated in current HTML and XHTML
      recommendations. The majority of presentational features from previous
      versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer
      accessibility, higher cost of site maintenance, and larger document sizes.
      Good semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents (see
      also Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). For example, when a screen
      reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a
      document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading
      out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up
      correctly.
