        The mobile web comprises mobile browser-based World Wide Web services
        accessed from handheld mobile devices, such as smartphones or feature
        phones, through a mobile or other wireless network.

      Traditionally, the World Wide Web has been accessed via fixed-line
      services on laptops and desktop computers. However, the web is now more
      accessible by portable and wireless devices. Early 2010 ITU (International
      Telecommunication Union) report said that with current growth rates, web
      access by people on the go – via laptops and smart mobile devices – was
      likely to exceed web access from desktop computers within the following
      five years. In January 2014, mobile internet use exceeded desktop use in
      the United States. The shift to mobile Web access has accelerated since
      2007 with the rise of larger multitouch smartphones, and since 2010 with
      the rise of multitouch tablet computers. Both platforms provide better
      Internet access, screens, and mobile browsers, or application-based user
      Web experiences than previous generations of mobile devices. Web designers
      may work separately on such pages, or pages may be automatically
      converted, as in Mobile Wikipedia. Faster speeds, smaller, feature-rich
      devices, and a multitude of applications continue to drive explosive
      growth for mobile internet traffic. The 2017 Virtual Network Index (VNI)
      report produced by Cisco Systems forecasts that by 2021, there will be 5.5
      billion global mobile users (up from 4.9 billion in 2016). Additionally,
      the same 2017 VNI report forecasts that average access speeds will
      increase by roughly three times from 6.8 Mbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in that same
      period with video comprising the bulk of the traffic (78%). According to
      BuzzCity, the mobile internet increased by 30% from Q1 to Q2 2011. In July
      2012, approximately 10.5% of all web traffic occurred through mobile
      devices (up from 4% in December 2010). The distinction between mobile web
      applications and native applications is anticipated to become increasingly
      blurred, as mobile browsers gain direct access to the hardware of mobile
      devices (including accelerometers and GPS chips), and the speed and
      abilities of browser-based applications improve. Persistent storage and
      access to sophisticated user interface graphics functions may further
      reduce the need for the development of platform-specific native
      applications. The mobile web has also been called Web 3.0, drawing
      parallels to the changes users were experiencing as Web 2.0 websites
      proliferated. Wikipedia viewed with Opera Mini mobile web browser on a
      small-screen cellphone The mobile web was first popularized by the Silicon
      Valley company, Unwired Planet.[9][failed verification] In 1997, Unwired
      Planet, Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola started the WAP Forum to create and
      harmonize the standards to ease the transition to bandwidth networks and
      small display devices. The WAP standard was built on a three-layer,
      middleware architecture that fueled the early growth of the mobile web. It
      was made virtually irrelevant after the development and adoption of faster
      networks, larger displays, and advanced smartphones based on Apple's iOS
      and Google's Android software.

      Mobile Internet refers to Internet access and mainly usage of Internet
      using a cellular telephone service provider or mobile wireless network.
      This wireless access can easily change to use a different wireless
      Internet (radio) tower as a mobile device user moves across the service
      area. Cellular base stations that connect through the telephone system are
      more expensive to provide compared to a wireless base station that
      connects directly to the network of an internet service provider. A mobile
      broadband modem may "tethers" the smartphone to one or more devices to
      provide access to the Internet via the protocols that cellular telephone
      service providers offer.

      The Mobile Web Initiative (MWI) was set up by the W3C to develop the best
      practices and technologies relevant to the mobile web. The goal of the
      initiative is to make browsing the web from mobile devices more reliable
      and accessible. The main aim is to evolve standards of data formats from
      Internet providers that are tailored to the specifications of particular
      mobile devices. The W3C has published guidelines for mobile content, and
      aimed to address the problem of device diversity by establishing a
      technology to support a repository of device descriptions. W3C developed a
      validating scheme to assess the readiness of content for the mobile web,
      through its mobileOK Scheme, which aims to help content developers to
      determine if their content is web-ready. The W3C guidelines and mobileOK
      approach have faced criticism.mTLD, the registry for .mobi, released a
      free testing tool called the MobiReady Report (see mobiForge) to analyze
      the mobile readiness of website.

      Access to the mobile web was first commercially offered in 1996, in
      Finland, on the Nokia 9000 Communicator phone via the Sonera and
      Radiolinja networks. The first commercial launch of a mobile-specific
      browser-based web service was in 1999 in Japan when i-mode was launched by
      NTT DoCoMo. Evolution of mobile web standards The mobile web primarily
      utilizes lightweight pages like this one written in Extensible Hypertext
      Markup Language (XHTML) or Wireless Markup Language (WML) to deliver
      content to mobile devices. Many new mobile browsers are moving beyond
      these limits by supporting a wider range of Web formats, including
      variants of HTML commonly found on the desktop web.

    <h3>Growth</h3>
    <p>
      At one time, half the world had mobile phones. The articles in 2007-2008
      were slightly misleading because the real story at the time was that the
      number of mobile phone subscriptions had reached half the population of
      the world. In reality, many people have more than one subscription. For
      example, in Hong Kong, Italy and Ukraine, the mobile phone penetration
      rate had passed 140% by 2009 . In 2009, the number of unique users of
      mobile phones had reached half the population of the planet when the ITU
      reported that the subscriber number was to reach 4.6 billion users which
      means 3.8 billion activated mobile phones in use, and 3.4 billion unique
      users of mobile phones. Mobile Internet data connections are following the
      growth of mobile phone connections, albeit at a lower rate. In 2009 Yankee
      Group reported that 29% of all mobile phone users globally were accessing
      browser-based internet content on their phones. According to the BBC, in
      2020 there were over 5 billion mobile phone users in the world. According
      to Statista there were 1.57 billion smartphone owners in 2014 and 2.32
      billion in 2017. Many users in Europe and the United States are already
      users of the fixed internet when they first try the same experience on a
      mobile phone. Meanwhile, in other parts of the world, such as India, their
      first usage of the internet is on a mobile phone. Growth is fastest in
      parts of the world where the personal computer (PC) is not the first user
      experience of the internet. India, South Africa, Indonesia, and Saudi
      Arabia are seeing the fastest growth in mobile internet usage. To a great
      extent, this is due to the rapid adoption of mobile phones themselves. For
      example, Morgan Stanley reports that the highest mobile phone adoption
      growth in 2006 was in Pakistan and India. Mobile internet has also been
      adopted in West Africa, and China had 155 million mobile internet users as
      of June 2009.

      The .mobi sponsored top-level domain was launched specifically for the
      mobile Internet by a consortium of companies including Google, Microsoft,
      Nokia, Samsung, and Vodafone. By forcing sites to comply with mobile web
      standards, .mobi tries to ensure visitors a consistent and optimized
      experience on their mobile device. However, this domain has been
      criticized by several big names, including Tim Berners-Lee of the W3C, who
      said that providing different content to different devices "breaks the Web
      in a fundamental way".

    <p>
      In the fall of 2015, Google announced it would be rolling out an open
      source initiative called "Accelerated Mobile Pages" or AMP. The goal of
      this project is to improve the speed and performance of content-rich pages
      which include video, animations, and graphics. Since the majority of the
      population now consumes the web through tablets and smartphones, having
      web pages that are optimized for these products is the primary need to
      AMP. The three main types of AMP are AMP HTML, AMP JS, and Google AMP
      Cache. As of February 2018, Google requires the canonical page content to
      match the content on accelerated mobile pages.

      <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    </center>
    <p>
      Mobile web access may suffer from interoperability and usability problems.
      Interoperability issues stem from the platform fragmentation of mobile
      devices, mobile operating systems, and browsers. Usability problems are
      centered on the small physical size of the mobile phone form factors,
      which limit display resolution and user input. Limitations vary, depending
      on the device, and newer smartphones overcome some of these restrictions,
      but problems which may be encountered include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Small screen size</b> – This makes it difficult or impossible to see
        text and graphics dependent on the standard size of a desktop computer
        screen. To display more information, smartphone screen sizes have been
        getting bigger.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lack of windows</b> – On a desktop computer, the ability to open more
        than one window at a time allows for multi-tasking and easy revert to a
        previous page. Historically on mobile web, only one page could be
        displayed at a time, and pages could only be viewed in the sequence they
        were originally accessed. Opera Mini was among the first allowing
        multiple windows, and browser tabs have become commonplace but few
        mobile browsers allow overlapping windows on the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Navigation</b> – Navigation is a problem for websites not optimized
        for mobile devices as the content area is large, the screen size is
        small, and there is no scroll wheel or hover box feature.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lack of JavaScript and cookies</b> – Most devices do not support
        client-side scripting and storage of cookies (smartphones excluded),
        which are now widely used in most web sites to enhance the user
        experience, facilitating the validation of data entered by the page
        visitor, etc. This also results in web analytics tools being unable to
        uniquely identify visitors using mobile devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Types of pages accessible</b> – Many sites that can be accessed on a
        desktop cannot on a mobile device. Many devices cannot access pages with
        a secured connection, Flash, or other similar software, PDFs, or video
        sites, although as of 2011, this has been changing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Speed</b> –On most mobile devices, the speed of service is slow,
        sometimes slower than dial-up Internet access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Broken pages</b> – On many devices, a single page as viewed on a
        desktop is broken into segments, each treated as a separate page. This
        further slows navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Compressed pages</b> – Many pages, in their conversion to mobile
        format, are squeezed into an order different from how they would
        customarily be viewed on a desktop computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Size of messages</b> – Many devices have limits on the number of
        characters that can be sent in an email message.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cost</b> – The access and bandwidth charges levied by cellphone
        networks can be high if there is no flat fee per month.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Location of mobile user</b> – If the user is abroad the flat fee per
        month usually does not apply
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Access to device capabilities</b> – The inability of mobile web
        applications to access the local capabilities on the mobile device can
        limit their ability to provide the same features as native applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
