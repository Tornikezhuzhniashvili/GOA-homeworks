      <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language
      used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in
      a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
      MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
      Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the
      separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
      fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, since the
      content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more
      flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
      characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
      specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
      complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
      file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
      share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content
      also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
      for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
      (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
      devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
      accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the
      specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more
      than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This
      cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are
      maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
      (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March
      1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
      documents. In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use
      of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the
      GTK widget toolkit.

    <p>
      CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify
      the names of various style properties.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Style sheet</strong></h2>
    <p>
      A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists
      of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
    </p>
</section>
    <h2><strong>Selector</strong></h2>
    <p>
      "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML,
      see class attribute (HTML). In CSS, selectors declare which part of the
      markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup
      itself.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Selector types</strong></h3>
    <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
      <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
      <li>
        id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector
        language by a hash prefix e.g
      </li>
      <li>
        class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document,
        denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class",
        although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified
        with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from
        browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on
        document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class"
        system of the Web content model)
      </li>
      <li>
        elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the
        document tree.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include
      alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to
      any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a
      single element.

    <h2><strong>Declaration block</strong></h2>
    <center>
      <a href="#nav">Go Back To Navigation</a>

    <p>
      A declaration block consists of a pair of braces ({}) enclosing a
      semicolon-separated list of declarations.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Declaration</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value.
      Optional white-space may be around the declaration block, declarations,
      colons, and semi-colons for readability.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Properties</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of
      possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element, and
      others apply only to particular groups of elements
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Values</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical
      values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of the viewport
      width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width). Color values can
      be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000,
      also abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255,
      0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g.
      rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(0 100% 50%), hsl(0
      100% 50% / 0.8)). Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures
      must include a length unit, which is either an alphabetic code or
      abbreviation, as in 200px or 50vw; or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some
      units – cm (centimetre); in (inch); mm (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt
      (point) – are absolute, which means that the rendered dimension does not
      depend upon the structure of the page; others – em (em); ex (ex) and px
      (pixel)[clarification needed] – are relative, which means that factors
      such as the font size of a parent element can affect the rendered
      measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1 and retained in
      all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3
      will, if adopted as a W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length
      units: ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.

      Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were
      contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles,
      element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described,
      often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that
      information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably
      simpler HTML. And additionally, as more and more devices are able to
      access responsive web pages, different screen sizes and layouts begin to
      appear. Customizing a website for each device size is costly and
      increasingly difficult. The modular nature of CSS means that styles can be
      reused in different parts of a site or even across sites, promoting
      consistency and efficiency. For example, headings (h1 elements),
      sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally
      using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and
      emphasis for these elements is presentational. Before CSS, document
      authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all
      h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence
      of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more
      error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of
      presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment,
      size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics,
      and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also
      defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural
      text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational
      HTML markup.

      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, offers a flexible way to style web
      content, with styles originating from browser defaults, user preferences,
      or web designers. These styles can be applied inline, within an HTML
      document, or through external .css files for broader consistency. Not only
      does this simplify web development by promoting reusability and
      maintainability, it also improves site performance because styles can be
      offloaded into dedicated .css files that browsers can cache. Additionally,
      even if the styles cannot be loaded or are disabled, this separation
      maintains the accessibility and readability of the content, ensuring that
      the site is usable for all users, including those with disabilities. Its
      multi-faceted approach, including considerations for selector specificity,
      rule order, and media types, ensures that websites are visually coherent
      and adaptive across different devices and user needs, striking a balance
      between design intent and user accessibility.
