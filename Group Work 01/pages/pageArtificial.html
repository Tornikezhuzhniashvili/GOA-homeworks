      <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence
      exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of
      research in computer science that develops and studies methods and
      software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use
      learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of
      achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines
      (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon,
      and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri,
      and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative
      tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in
      strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not
      perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general
      applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes
      useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."
    </p>
    <p>
      The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals
      and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research
      include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural
      language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General
      intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an
      at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.[4] To reach
      these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of
      techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic,
      artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations
      research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics,
      philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6]
      and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by
      periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[9][10]
      Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning
      outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further
      after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s
      hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the
      "AI boom"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several
      unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about
      its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about
      regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

      The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been
      broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or
      capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The
      traits described below have received the most attention and cover the
      scope of AI research.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Reasoning and problem-solving">Reasoning and problem-solving</h3>
    <p>
      Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step
      reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical
      deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for
      dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from
      probability and economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning
      problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become
      exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the
      step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most
      of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and
      efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Knowledge representation">Knowledge representation</h3>
    <p>
      Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to
      answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.
      Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and
      retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge
      discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large
      databases), and other areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be
      used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts,
      and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases
      need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and
      relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes
      and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other
      people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until
      they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are
      changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the
      breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average
      person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense
      knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or
      "statements" that they could express verbally). There is also the
      difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge
      for AI applications.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Planning and decision-making">Planning and decision-making</h3>
    <p>
      An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A
      rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them
      happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33]
      In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some
      situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to
      avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation
      (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For
      each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility
      of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that
      the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum
      expected utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any
      action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may
      not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or
      "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after
      each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action
      by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if
      the action worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if
      there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g.,
      with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to
      improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh
      the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of
      possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so
      the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain
      of what the outcome will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the
      probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular
      way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the
      cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible
      state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic,
      or it can be learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents
      and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.

    <h3 id="Search and optimization">Search and optimization</h3>
    <p>
      AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many
      possible solutions.[68] There are two very different kinds of search used
      in AI: state space search and local search.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 id="Local search">Local search</h3>
    <p>
      Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a
      problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of
      numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss
      function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural
      networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to
      iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and
      "recombining" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence
      algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm
      optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization
      (inspired by ant trails).
