    <hr />
    <p>
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is
      a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and
      CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
      behavior. Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes
      the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a
      variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is
      Node.js. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
      that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
      include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
      facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
      JavaScript APIs for I/O. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name,
      syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct
      and differ greatly in design.

    <h2>Creation at Netscape</h2>
    <section name="" id="Creation at Netscape">
      <p>
        The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic,
        was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
        prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web. The lead
        developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which
        released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This
        quickly became the most-used. During these formative years of the Web,
        web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
        behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in
        the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in
        1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They
        pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems
        to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the
        Scheme language. The goal was a "language for the masses", "to help
        nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites". Netscape
        management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a
        new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other
        extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its
        interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as
        part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to
        JavaScript for the official release in December. The choice of the
        JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly
        related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a
        popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing
        ploy by Netscape.

      <h1>Adoption by Microsoft</h1>
    </center>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with
      Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter
      called JScript. Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside
      initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these
      implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in
      Netscape Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to
      make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use
      of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos
      for several years.
    </p>

    <h1 id="The rise of JScript">The rise of JScript</h1>

    <p>
      In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as
      the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors
      could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript
      language specification in June 1997. The standards process continued for a
      few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3
      in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000. However, the effort
      to fully standardize the language was undermined by Microsoft gaining an
      increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s,
      Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript
      became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.
      Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented
      some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped
      collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.

    <h1 id="Growth and standardization">Growth and standardization</h1>

    <p>
      During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s,
      client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when
      the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox
      was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet
      Explorer. In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on
      the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly
      with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing
      E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4
      draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript
      4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an
      open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too
      different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation
      from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition. Meanwhile, very
      important developments were occurring in open-source communities not
      affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white
      paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of
      technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web
      applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need
      for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript,
      spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed
      around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype,
      Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools. Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008,
      with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition. The
      key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser
      vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT. In July 2008, these
      disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the
      eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive
      the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released
      in December 2009.

    <h1 id="Reaching maturity">Reaching maturity</h1>
    <p>
      Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in
      an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with
      the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015. The creation of Node.js in 2009
      by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript
      outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and
      I/O APIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system. As of
      2018, Node had been used by millions of developers, and npm had the most
      modules of any package manager in the world. The ECMAScript draft
      specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are
      produced via regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language
      are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process. Now, instead of
      edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features
      individually. The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and
      frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of
      JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page
      applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have
      been created to aid the development process.

        Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web

        most-used. Other notable ones include Angular, Bootstrap, Lodash,
        Modernizr, React, Underscore, and Vue. Multiple options can be used in
        conjunction, such as jQuery and Bootstrap. However, the term "Vanilla
        JS" was coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at
        all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.

      <p>
        The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots.
        JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software
        systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser
        applications. Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage
        were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information
        Services, but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually
        started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and
        other approaches. Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application
        frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior
        implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe
        Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions
        written in JavaScript. JavaScript has been used in some embedded
        systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.

    <h2>JavaScript engine</h2>
    <p>
      This section is an excerpt from JavaScript engine. A JavaScript engine is
      a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript
      engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use
      just-in-time compilation for improved performance. JavaScript engines are
      typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has
      one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the
      rendering engine via the Document Object Model and Web IDL bindings.
      However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for
      example, the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.
      Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript,
      ECMAScript engine is another name for these implementations. With the
      advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code in the same
      sandbox as regular JavaScript cod
    </p>

    <h1 id="Runtime system">Runtime system</h1>
    <p>
      A JavaScript engine must be embedded within a runtime system (such as a
      web browser or a standalone system) to enable scripts to interact with the
      broader environment. The runtime system includes the necessary APIs for
      input/output operations, such as networking, storage, and graphics, and
      provides the ability to import scripts. JavaScript is a single-threaded
      language. The runtime processes messages from a queue one at a time, and
      it calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call
      stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call
      stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack
      is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message
      in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as "run to
      completion" because each message is fully processed before the next
      message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes
      the event loop as non-blocking: program I/O is performed using events and
      callback functions. This means, for example, that JavaScript can process a
      mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.

    <p>
      The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript
      implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.
    </p>
    <section id="Imperative and structured">
      <h2>Imperative and structured</h2>
      <p>Main article: Structured programming</p>
      <p>
        JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C
        (e.g., <button>if</button> statements, <button>while</button> loops,
        <button>switch</button> statements, <button>do while</button> loops,
        etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had
        function scoping with <button>var</button>; block scoping was added in
        ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords <button>let</button> and
        <button>const</button>. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between
        expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic
        semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements)
        to be omitted.
      </p>

      <h1 id="Weakly typed">Weakly typed</h1>
      <p>Main article: Weakly typed</p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly
        cast depending on the operation used.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The binary <button>+</button>operator casts both operands to a string
          unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition
          operator doubles as a concatenation operator.
        </li>
        <li>
          The binary <button>-</button> operator always casts both operands to a
          number
        </li>
        <li>
          Both unary operators <button>(+, -)</button> always cast the operand
          to a number
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Values are cast to strings like the following:</p>

        prototype for string and number casting respectively. JavaScript has
        received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the
        complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example,
        when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string
        before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a
        string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.

      Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as:
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are
      mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them
      new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer
      objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects
      inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?[61] In
      JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype
      (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there
      are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation
      <button>(obj.x = 10)</button> and bracket notation
      <button>(obj['x'] = 10)</button>. A property may be added, rebound, or
      deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that
      belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated
      using a <button>for...in</button> loop.
    </p>

      <p>Main article: Prototype-based programming</p>

        <strong>JavaScript</strong> uses prototypes where many other

    <section id="Functions as object constructors">
      <h2>Functions as object constructors</h2>
      <p>
        Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role.
        Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a
        prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor
        (including properties from the <button>Object</button> prototype).
        ECMAScript 5 offers the <button>Object.create</button>method, allowing
        explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from
        the <button>Object</button> prototype (older environments can assign the
        prototype to <button>null</button>). The constructor's
        <button>prototype</button> property determines the object used for the
        new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying
        the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's
        built-in constructors, such as <button>Array</button> or
        <button>Object</button>, also have prototypes that can be modified.
        While it is possible to modify the <button>Object</button>
        prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects
        in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object
        prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified.

        Unlike in many object-oriented languages, in

        definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs
        during function calling. When a function is called as a method of an

      A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is

        A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via <button>call</button> or

        behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain.

      <h2>Object composition and inheritance</h2>
      <p>
        Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in
        JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype
        chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related
        to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it
        gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript
        is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype
        property of constructor functions.

      <p>
        JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to
        deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors
        minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a
        sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not
        general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts
        are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one website do
        not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies
        sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches
        of either the same origin policy or the sandbox. There are subsets of
        general JavaScript—ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)—that provide greater
        levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as
        advertisements). Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding
        and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML. Content Security

      <p>
        A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting
        (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur
        when an attacker can cause a target Website, such as an online banking
        website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a
        victim. The script in this example can then access the banking
        application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing
        secret information or transferring money without the victim's
        authorization. One important solution to XSS vulnerabilities is HTML
        sanitization. Some browsers include partial protection against reflected
        XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious
        script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other
        XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a
        database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server-side can
        fully prevent XSS. XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of
        implementation mistakes by browser authors.

    <h2 id="Cross-site request forgery">Cross-site request forgery</h2>
    <p>
      Another cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In
      CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking
      actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money
      at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request
      authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can
      carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general,
      the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden
      form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that
      might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also
      help.

      <p>
        Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted
        clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author
        cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at
        all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a
        determined adversary. Some implications are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Website authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates
          because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can
          be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse-engineered.
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not
          security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of
          service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only
          contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on
          to prevent operations such as right-clicking on an image to save it.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such

        Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with
        JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage
        their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries.
        Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them
        secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability
        has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have
        new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all
        programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go
        unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done
        looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37% of the
        websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability. "The
        median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and
        the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and
        development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago."
        Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the
        library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed
        his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and
        websites depending upon his libraries to break.
