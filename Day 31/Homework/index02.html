        Joel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954)[1] and Ethan Jesse Coen (born
        September 21, 1957),[2] together known as the Coen brothers (/ˈkoʊən/),
        are an American filmmaking duo. Their films span many genres and styles,
        which they frequently subvert or parody.[3] Among their most acclaimed
        works are Blood Simple (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), Miller's Crossing
        (1990), Barton Fink (1991), Fargo (1996), The Big Lebowski (1998), O
        Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), No Country for Old Men (2007), A
        Serious Man (2009), True Grit (2010) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). The
        brothers generally write, direct and produce their films jointly,
        although due to DGA regulations, Joel received sole directing credit
        while Ethan received sole production credit until The Ladykillers
        (2004), from which point on they would be credited together as directors
        and producers; they also shared editing credits under the alias Roderick
        Jaynes. The duo started directing separately in the 2020s, resulting in
        Joel's The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021) and Ethan's Jerry Lee Lewis:
        Trouble in Mind (2022) and Drive-Away Dolls (2024). They have been
        nominated for 13 Academy Awards together, plus one individual nomination
        for each, sharing Best Original Screenplay for Fargo, and Best Picture,
        Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for No Country for Old Men.
        They won the Palme d'Or for Barton Fink at the 1991 Cannes Film
        Festival. The Coens have written films for other directors, including
        Sam Raimi's Crimewave (1985), Angelina Jolie's World War II biopic
        Unbroken (2014) and Steven Spielberg's Cold War drama Bridge of Spies
        (2015). They produced Terry Zwigoff's Bad Santa (2003) and John
        Turturro's Romance and Cigarettes (2005). Ethan is also a writer of
        short stories, theater and poetry. They are known for their distinctive
        stylistic trademarks including genre hybridity.[4] No Country for Old
        Men, A Serious Man and Inside Llewyn Davis were included on the BBC's
        2016 poll of the greatest motion pictures since 2000.[5] In 1998, the
        American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Fargo among the 100 greatest
        American movies.[6] Richard Corliss wrote of the Coens: "Dexterously
        flipping and reheating old movie genres like so many pancakes, they
        serve them up fresh, not with syrup but with a coating of comic
        arsenic."[7]
