        Quentin Jerome Tarantino (/ˌtærənˈtiːnoʊ/; born March 27, 1963) is an
        American filmmaker, actor, and author. His films are characterized by
        stylized violence, extended dialogue often featuring much profanity, and
        references to popular culture. His work has earned a cult following
        alongside critical and commercial success; he has been named by some as
        the single most influential director of his generation and has received
        numerous awards and nominations, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA
        Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. Tarantino began his career with
        the independent crime drama film Reservoir Dogs (1992). His second film,
        the crime drama Pulp Fiction (1994), was a major success and won
        numerous awards, including the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or and the
        Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He next wrote and starred in
        the action horror film From Dusk till Dawn (1996). His third film as
        director, the crime drama Jackie Brown (1997), paid homage to
        blaxploitation films. Tarantino wrote and directed the martial arts
        films Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004), with
        both volumes combined regarded as a single film. He then made the
        exploitation-slasher film Death Proof (2007), which was part of a double
        feature with From Dusk till Dawn director Robert Rodriguez, released
        under the collective title Grindhouse. His next film, Inglourious
        Basterds (2009), followed an alternate account of World War II. He
        followed this with Django Unchained (2012), a slave revenge Spaghetti
        Western which won him his second Academy Award for Best Original
        Screenplay. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a revisionist
        Western thriller and opened to audiences with a roadshow release.
        Tarantino's most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), was
        a comedy-drama set in the late 1960s about the transition of Old
        Hollywood to New Hollywood; his debut novel, a novelization of the film,
        was published in 2021. He has said that, though it is not definite, his
        current plan is for his next film to be his last before he retires.

        Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 27,
        1963,[1] the only child of Connie McHugh and aspiring actor Tony
        Tarantino, who left the family before his son's birth.[2] He has claimed
        to have Cherokee ancestry through his mother, who was also of Irish
        descent, while his father was Italian-American.[2][3] He was named in
        part after Quint Asper, Burt Reynolds's character in the TV series
        Gunsmoke.[4] Tarantino's mother met his father during a trip to Los
        Angeles; after a brief marriage and divorce, she left Los Angeles and
        moved to Knoxville, where her parents lived, and returned to Los Angeles
        with her son in 1966.[5][6] Tarantino's mother married musician Curtis
        Zastoupil soon after arriving in Los Angeles, and the family moved to
        nearby Torrance, California.[7][8] Zastoupil accompanied Tarantino to
        numerous film screenings while his mother allowed him to see more mature
        movies, such as Carnal Knowledge (1971) and Deliverance (1972). After
        his mother divorced Zastoupil in 1973 and received a misdiagnosis of
        Hodgkin's lymphoma, Tarantino was again sent to live with his
        grandparents in Knoxville. Less than a year later, he returned to
        Torrance.[9][10] At the age of 14, Tarantino wrote one of his earliest
        works, a screenplay called Captain Peachfuzz and the Anchovy Bandit that
        was based on the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit. He later revealed that
        his mother had ridiculed his writing skills when he was younger, and he
        subsequently vowed never to share any of his future wealth with her.[11]
        As a 15-year-old, he was grounded by his mother for shoplifting Elmore
        Leonard's novel The Switch from a Kmart. He was allowed to leave only to
        attend the Torrance Community Theater, where he participated in such
        plays as Two Plus Two Makes Sex and Romeo and Juliet.[9] The same year,
        he dropped out of Narbonne High School in Harbor City.[12][13]
