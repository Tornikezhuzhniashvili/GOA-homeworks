</center>
<p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a cola soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200<br> countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day. Coca-Cola ranked No. 94 in<br> the 2024 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study of<br> 2023, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable. </p>

<p>Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late 19th century by John <br> Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing <br> tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century. The name refers to <br> of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade; <br> however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. The secrecy around the formula has been <br>used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula. The drink has inspired imitators and <br>created a whole classification of soft drink: colas.</p>
