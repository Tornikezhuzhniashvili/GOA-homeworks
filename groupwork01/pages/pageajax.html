    <p>
      Ajax (also AJAX ; short for "asynchronous JavaScript and XML") is a set of
      web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the
      client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web
      applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in
      the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the
      existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the
      presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web
      applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the
      entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON
      instead of XML. Ajax is not a technology, but rather a programming
      concept. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style
      information. The webpage can be modified by JavaScript to dynamically
      displayâ€”and allow the user to interact with the new information. The
      built-in XMLHttpRequest object is used to execute Ajax on webpages,
      allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the
      page. Ajax is not a new technology, nor is it a new language. Instead, it
      is existing technologies used in a new way.

      <p>
        In the early-to-mid 1990s, most Websites were based on complete HTML
        pages. Each user action required a complete new page to be loaded from
        the server. This process was inefficient, as reflected by the user
        experience: all page content disappeared, then the new page appeared.
        Each time the browser reloaded a page because of a partial change, all
        the content had to be re-sent, even though only some of the information
        had changed. This placed additional load on the server and made
        bandwidth a limiting factor in performance. In 1996, the iframe tag was
        introduced by Internet Explorer; like the object element,[citation
        needed] it can load a part of the web page asynchronously. In 1998, the
        Microsoft Outlook Web Access team developed the concept behind the
        XMLHttpRequest scripting object. It appeared as XMLHTTP in the second
        version of the MSXML library, which shipped with Internet Explorer 5.0
        in March 1999. The functionality of the Windows XMLHTTP ActiveX control
        in IE 5 was later implemented by Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, Google
        Chrome, and other browsers as the XMLHttpRequest JavaScript object.
        Microsoft adopted the native XMLHttpRequest model as of Internet
        Explorer 7. The ActiveX version is still supported in Internet Explorer,
        but not in Microsoft Edge. The utility of these background HTTP requests
        and asynchronous Web technologies remained fairly obscure until it
        started appearing in large scale online applications such as Outlook Web
        Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002). Google made a wide deployment of
        standards-compliant, cross browser Ajax with Gmail (2004) and Google
        Maps (2005). In October 2004 Kayak.com's public beta release was among
        the first large-scale e-commerce uses of what their developers at that
        time called "the xml http thing". This increased interest in Ajax among
        web program developers. The term AJAX was publicly used on 18 February
        2005 by Jesse James Garrett in an article titled Ajax: A New Approach to
        Web Applications, based on techniques used on Google pages. On 5 April
        2006, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first draft
        specification for the XMLHttpRequest object in an attempt to create an
        official Web standard. The latest draft of the XMLHttpRequest object was
        published on 6 October 2016, and the XMLHttpRequest specification is now
        a living standard.

      The term Ajax has come to represent a broad group of Web technologies that
      can be used to implement a Web application that communicates with a server
      in the background, without interfering with the current state of the page.
      In the article that coined the term Ajax, Jesse James Garrett explained
      that the following technologies are incorporated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML (or XHTML) and CSS for presentation</li>
      <li>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) for dynamic display of and interaction
        with data
      </li>
      <li>
        JSON or XML for the interchange of data, and XSLT for XML manipulation
      </li>
      <li>The XMLHttpRequest object for asynchronous communication</li>
      <li>JavaScript to bring these technologies together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Ajax offers several benefits that can significantly enhance web
      application performance and user experience. By reducing server traffic
      and improving speed, Ajax plays a crucial role in modern web development.
      One key advantage of Ajax is its capacity to render web applications
      without requiring data retrieval, resulting in reduced server traffic.
      This optimization minimizes response times on both the server and client
      sides, eliminating the need for users to endure loading screens.
      Furthermore, Ajax facilitates asynchronous processing by simplifying the
      utilization of XmlHttpRequest, which enables efficient handling of
      requests for asynchronous data retrieval. Additionally, the dynamic
      loading of content enhances the application's performance significantly.
      Besides, Ajax enjoys broad support across all major web browsers,
      including Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5 and above, Mozilla
      Firefox versions 1.0 and beyond, Opera versions 7.6 and above, and Apple
      Safari versions 1.2 and higher.
