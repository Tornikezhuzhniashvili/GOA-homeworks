      The sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series consists of the BMW F10 (saloon
      version), F18 (long-wheelbase saloon), BMW F11 (wagon, marketed as
      Touring) and BMW F07 (fastback/hatchback, marketed as Gran Turismo)
      executive cars and were produced by BMW from January 2010 (for the 2011
      model year) to 2017, with F10 being launched on 20 March 2010 to domestic
      market and F11 in the summer of 2010.[10] The F07 Gran Turismo was
      produced from early September 2009[11][12] to 2017, being launched in the
      domestic German market in late October 2009.

      The F10 5 Series shares a platform with the F01 7 Series full-size luxury
      saloon and the F12 6 Series executive-sized grand tourers.[13][14][15] The
      F10 generation is the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a
      turbocharged V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, a dual-clutch
      transmission (in the M5), active rear-wheel steering (called "Integral
      Active Steering"), electric power steering, double-wishbone front
      suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called "Black Panel Display") and
      automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant").[16] A long-wheelbase
      saloon version (model code F18) was sold in China, Mexico, Turkey and the
      Middle East. Introduced in 2011, the M5 model is powered by the BMW S63
      twin-turbocharged V8 engine coupled to a 7-speed dual clutch transmission.
      The Gran Turismo (F07) is the first and only 5 Series to be produced in a
      fastback body style with a hatchback truck opening.
