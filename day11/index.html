    <h2>Largest and heaviest animals</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The largest animal currently alive is the blue whale. The maximum recorded
      weight was 190 tonnes (209 US tons) for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres
      (91 ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33 metres (108 ft), have been recorded
      but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated that this individual could have
      a mass of 250 tonnes or more.[4][5][6] The longest non-colonial animal is
      the lion's mane jellyfish (37 m, 120 ft).[7] In 2023, paleontologists
      estimated that the extinct whale Perucetus, discovered in Peru, may have
      outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85 to 340 t (94–375 short tons;
      84–335 long tons).[8] However, more recent studies suggest this whale was
      much smaller than previous estimates putting its weight at 60 to 113
      tonnes.[9] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod
      Bruhathkayosaurus suggest it was around 110–170 tons, with the highest
      estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with Patagotitan, although actual
      fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described
      dimensions in 1987.[10] In April 2024, Ichthyotitan severnensis was
      established as a valid shastasaurid taxon and is considered both the
      largest marine reptile ever discovered and the largest macropredator ever
      discovered. The Lilstock specimen was estimated to be around 26 metres (85
      ft) whilst the Aust specimen was an even more impressive 30 to 35 metres
      (98 to 115 ft) in length. Whilst no weight estimates was made as of yet,
      Ichthyotitan would have easily rivalled or surpassed the blue
      whale.[11][12] The upper estimates of weight for these prehistoric animals
      would have easily rivaled or exceeded the largest rorquals and
      sauropods.[13] The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the
      largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in
      sub-Saharan Africa, males weigh about 6.0 tonnes (13,200 lb) on
      average.[14] The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in
      1974. It was a male measuring 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) from trunk to tail
      and 4.17 metres (13.7 ft) lying on its side in a projected line from the
      highest point of the shoulder, to the base of the forefoot, indicating a
      standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0 ft). This male had a
      computed weight of 10.4 to 12.25 tonnes.

    <h2>Blue whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a baleen
      whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 m (98 ft) and weighing
      up to 199 t (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest animal
      known ever to have existed.[a] The blue whale's long and slender body can
      be of various shades of greyish-blue on its upper surface and somewhat
      lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: B. m. musculus in the
      North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean,
      B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South
      Pacific Ocean, and B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is a
      population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.
      In general, blue whale populations migrate between their summer feeding
      areas near the poles and their winter breeding grounds near the tropics.
      There is also evidence of year-round residencies, and partial or
      age/sex-based migration. Blue whales are filter feeders; their diet
      consists almost exclusively of krill. They are generally solitary or
      gather in small groups, and have no well-defined social structure other
      than mother–calf bonds. Blue whales vocalize, with a fundamental frequency
      ranging from 8 to 25 Hz; their vocalizations may vary by region, season,
      behavior, and time of day. Orcas are their only natural predators. The
      blue whale was abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of
      the 19th century. It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by
      whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale
      hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has
      listed blue whales as Endangered as of 2018. It continues to face numerous
      man-made threats such as ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise, and climate
      change.

    <h2>North Pacific right whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Northeast Pacific population, which summers in the southeastern Bering
      Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 40 animals. A western
      population that summers near the Commander Islands, the coast of
      Kamchatka, along the Kuril Islands and in the Sea of Okhotsk is thought to
      number in the low hundreds. Before commercial whaling in the North Pacific
      (i.e. pre-1835) there were probably over 20,000 right whales in the
      region. The taking of right whales in commercial whaling has been
      prohibited by one or more international treaties since 1935. Nevertheless,
      between 1962 and 1968, illegal Soviet whaling killed at least 529 right
      whales in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska as well as at least 132
      right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk,[5] plus an additional 104 North
      Pacific right whales from unspecified areas. The International Union for
      Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as "Endangered", and
      categorizes the Northeast Pacific population as "Critically Endangered".
      The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right
      whale is the most endangered whale on Earth.

    <h2>Southern right whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) is a baleen whale, one of
      three species classified as right whales belonging to the genus Eubalaena.
      Southern right whales inhabit oceans south of the Equator, between the
      latitudes of 20° and 60° south.[5] In 2009 the global population was
      estimated to be approximately 13,600.

    <h2>Fin whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), also known as the finback whale or
      common rorqual, is a species of baleen whale and the second-longest
      cetacean after the blue whale. The biggest individual reportedly measured
      26 m (85 ft) in length, with a maximum recorded weight of 77 to 81 tonnes.
      The fin whale's body is long, slender and brownish-gray in color, with a
      paler underside to appear less conspicuous from below (countershading). At
      least two recognized subspecies exist, one in the North Atlantic and one
      across the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from
      polar to tropical waters, though it is absent only from waters close to
      the pack ice at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from
      the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and
      cool waters. Its prey mainly consists of smaller schooling fish, small
      squid, or crustaceans, including copepods and krill. Mating takes place in
      temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter. Fin whales are often
      observed in pods of 6–10 animals, with whom they communicate utilizing
      frequency-modulated sounds, ranging from 16 to 40 hertz. Like all other
      large whales, the fin whale was a prized kill during the "heyday” of
      whaling, from 1840 to 1861. It remained so into the 20th century but
      decades of over harvesting contributed to declining numbers through the
      late 20th century. Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the
      Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976. Post-recovery numbers of the
      southern subspecies are predicted to be less than 50% of the pre-whaling
      population, even by 2100, due to long-lasting impacts of whaling and slow
      recovery rates. As of 2018, it was assessed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

    <h2>Bowhead whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) is a species of baleen whale
      belonging to the family Balaenidae and is the only living representative
      of the genus Balaena. It is the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic
      and subarctic waters, and is named after its characteristic massive
      triangular skull, which it uses to break through Arctic ice. Other common
      names of the species included the Greenland right whale, Arctic whale,
      steeple-top, and polar whale. Bowheads have the largest mouth of any
      animal[6] representing almost one-third of the length of the body, the
      longest baleen plates with a maximum length of 4 metres (13 feet), and may
      be the longest-lived mammals, with the ability to reach an age of more
      than 200 years.[ The bowhead was an early whaling target. Their population
      was severely reduced before a 1966 moratorium was passed to protect the
      species. Of the five stocks of bowhead populations, three are listed as
      "endangered", one as "vulnerable", and one as "lower risk, conservation
      dependent" according to the IUCN Red List. The global population is
      assessed as of least concern.

    <h2>North Atlantic right whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is a baleen whale,
      one of three right whale species belonging to the genus Eubalaena, all of
      which were formerly classified as a single species. Because of their
      docile nature, their slow surface-skimming feeding behaviors, their
      tendencies to stay close to the coast, and their high blubber content
      (which makes them float when they are killed, and which produces high
      yields of whale oil), right whales were once a preferred target for
      whalers. At present, they are among the most endangered whales in the
      world, and they are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and
      Marine Mammal Protection Act and Canada's Species at Risk Act. There are
      an estimated 356 individuals in existence in the western North Atlantic
      Ocean—they migrate between feeding grounds in the Labrador Sea and their
      winter calving areas off Georgia and Florida, an ocean area with heavy
      shipping traffic. In the eastern North Atlantic, on the other hand—with a
      total population reaching into the low teens at most—scientists believe
      that they may already be functionally extinct.[dubious – discuss] Vessel
      strikes and entanglement in fixed fishing gear, which together account for
      nearly half of all North Atlantic right whale mortality since 1970, are
      their two greatest threats to recovery.

    <h2>Sperm whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The sperm whale or cachalot[a] (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of
      the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator. It is the only living
      member of the genus Physeter and one of three extant species in the sperm
      whale family, along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of
      the genus Kogia. The sperm whale is a pelagic mammal with a worldwide
      range, and will migrate seasonally for feeding and breeding. Females and
      young males live together in groups, while mature males (bulls) live
      solitary lives outside of the mating season. The females cooperate to
      protect and nurse their young. Females give birth every four to twenty
      years, and care for the calves for more than a decade. A mature, healthy
      sperm whale has no natural predators, although calves and weakened adults
      are sometimes killed by pods of killer whales (orcas). Mature males
      average 16 metres (52 ft) in length, with the head representing up to
      one-third of the animal's length. Plunging to 2,250 metres (7,380 ft), it
      is the third deepest diving mammal, exceeded only by the southern elephant
      seal and Cuvier's beaked whale. The sperm whale uses echolocation and
      vocalization with source level as loud as 236 decibels (re 1 μPa m)
      underwater, the loudest of any animal. It has the largest brain on Earth,
      more than five times heavier than a human's. Sperm whales can live 70
      years or more. Sperm whales' heads are filled with a waxy substance called
      "spermaceti" (sperm oil), from which the whale derives its name.
      Spermaceti was a prime target of the whaling industry and was sought after
      for use in oil lamps, lubricants, and candles. Ambergris, a solid waxy
      waste product sometimes present in its digestive system, is still highly
      valued as a fixative in perfumes, among other uses. Beachcombers look out
      for ambergris as flotsam. Sperm whaling was a major industry in the 19th
      century, depicted in the novel Moby-Dick. The species is protected by the
      International Whaling Commission moratorium, and is listed as vulnerable
      by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

    <h2>Humpback whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a species of baleen whale.
      It is a rorqual (a member of the family Balaenopteridae) and is the only
      species in the genus Megaptera. Adults range in length from 14–17 m (46–56
      ft) and weigh up to 40 metric tons (44 short tons). The humpback has a
      distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and tubercles on its head.
      It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making
      it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song typically
      lasting 4 to 33 minutes. Found in oceans and seas around the world,
      humpback whales typically migrate up to 16,000 km (9,900 mi) each year.
      They feed in polar waters and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to
      breed and give birth. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish,
      and they use bubbles to catch prey. They are promiscuous breeders, with
      both sexes having multiple partners. Orcas are the main natural predators
      of humpback whales. Like other large whales, the humpback was a target for
      the whaling industry. Humans once hunted the species to the brink of
      extinction; its population fell to around 5,000 by the 1960s. Numbers have
      partially recovered to some 135,000 animals worldwide, while entanglement
      in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution continue to
      affect the species.

    <h2>Sei whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The sei whale (/seɪ/ SAY,[4] Norwegian: [sæɪ]; Balaenoptera borealis) is a
      baleen whale. It is one of ten rorqual species, and the third-largest
      member after the blue and fin whales. It can grow to 19.5 m (64 ft) in
      length and weigh as much as 28 t (28 long tons; 31 short tons). Two
      subspecies are recognized: B. b. borealis and B. b. schlegelii. The
      whale's ventral surface has sporadic markings ranging from light grey to
      white, and its body is usually dark steel grey in colour. It is among the
      fastest of all cetaceans, and can reach speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph)
      over short distances. It inhabits most oceans and adjoining seas, and
      prefers deep offshore waters. It avoids polar and tropical waters and
      semi-enclosed bodies of water. The sei whale migrates annually from cool,
      subpolar waters in summer to temperate, subtropical waters in winter with
      a lifespan of 70 years. It is a filter feeder, with its diet consisting
      primarily of copepods, krill, and other zooplankton. It is typically
      solitary or can be found in groups numbering half a dozen. During the
      breeding period, a mating pair will remain together. Sei whale
      vocalizations usually lasts half a second, and occurs at 240–625 hertz.
      Following large-scale commercial whaling during the late 19th and 20th
      centuries, when over 255,000 whales were killed, the sei whale is now
      internationally protected. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red
      List, despite increasing populations. The Northern Hemisphere population
      is listed under CITES Appendix II, which indicates they are not threatened
      with extinction, while the Southern Hemisphere population is listed under
      CITES Appendix I, indicating that they are threatened and are given the
      highest levels of protection.

    <h2>Gray whale</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), also known as the grey whale, is a
      baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It
      reaches a length of 14.9 meters (49 ft), a weight of up to 41 tonnes
      (90,000 lb) and lives between 55 and 70 years, although one female was
      estimated to be 75–80 years of age. The common name of the whale comes
      from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin.[8] Gray whales
      were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when
      hunted. The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus
      Eschrichtius. It is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae,
      however some recent studies classify it as a member of the family
      Balaenopteridae. This mammal is descended from filter-feeding whales that
      appeared during the Neogene. The gray whale is distributed in a Northeast
      Pacific (North American), and an endangered Northwest Pacific (Asian),
      population. North Atlantic populations were extirpated (perhaps by
      whaling) on the European coast before 500 CE, and on the American and
      African Atlantic coasts around the late 17th to early 18th centuries.
      However, in the 2010s and 2020s there have been rare sightings of gray
      whales in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and even off South Atlantic
      coasts.
