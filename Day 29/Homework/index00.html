        Chimaev was born on May 1, 1994 to a Chechen family.[2][3] He was born
        in the village of Gvardeyskoye, then part of the Chechen Republic of
        Ichkeria but now part of Russia's Chechnya.[19] He started wrestling at
        the age of five in the village of Gvardeyskoye.[20] It has been reported
        he won a bronze medal at the Russian National Championships in the
        junior level.[21][22] In 2013, when he was 18, he emigrated to Sweden
        with his mother, joining his older brother.[23] However, despite living
        in Sweden for years, Khamzat never acquired a Swedish citizenship,
        keeping his Russian citizenship. In 2023, Khamzat moved to the
        UAE.[24][25]

        After moving to Sweden, Chimaev wrestled at multiple clubs, including BK
        Athén.[26] Considered one of the best freestyle wrestlers in the
        country,[27] Chimaev won a gold medal at the 2016 and 2017 Swedish
        Freestyle National Championships at 86 kilograms, and in 2018 he did so
        at 92 kilograms. Chimaev has had a series of dominant performances in
        the tournament, posting an overall record of 12–0, which includes three
        pins, seven technical falls and holds a combined score of 105 points,
        while only surrendering two himself, across all of his three
        showdowns.[28][29][26] Chimaev has competed in a few judo tournaments
        and in four combat sambo fights.[21] Chimaev competed against fellow UFC
        contender Jack Hermansson in a freestyle wrestling match on 19 November
        2021, at Sweden-based Bulldog Fight Night 9, winning on points.[30]

        Chimaev first started training in MMA when he was 23 years old. He
        trained at Allstars Training Center in Stockholm, along with three-time
        UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challenger Alexander Gustafsson, Ilir
        Latifi and Reza Madadi among others.[9] Gustafsson (one of his main
        training partners) told a Swedish reporter that Chimaev was one of the
        best fighters he had ever trained with, during a press conference in
        June 2019.[31]

        In an interview with ESPN, Chimaev claimed he was inspired to start
        training in MMA during a night at work where he took a 15-minute break
        to watch the Aldo vs. McGregor main event. Chimaev stated, "I was
        watching his [McGregor's] fight. I was watching him fight Aldo. I was
        sitting in night and was working. I was taking rest for 15 minutes and
        watched his fight. I always look at that like if the guys make so many
        money like millions and this stuff, why I can't do it now. I'm a
        fighter, I'm a warrior and I have something special inside me. I had to
        find some way and take out this to show to the people."[32] Between
        September 2017 and April 2018, Chimaev had three amateur MMA fights. The
        first of them was against future IMMAF World Champion Khaled Laallam,
        whom he defeated via submission in the second round.[33] He won his
        following two amateur fights, one by submission and one by technical
        knockout, completing his amateur career with a record of 3–0.[34]
        Chimaev turned professional on 26 May 2018, at International Ring Fight
        Arena 14, against Gard Olve Sagen.[35] He won the fight via technical
        knockout in the second round.[36] Chimaev's next fight took place on 18
        August 2018, against Ole Magnor at Fight Club Rush 3.[37] He won via
        submission with a rear naked choke late in the first round.[38]
