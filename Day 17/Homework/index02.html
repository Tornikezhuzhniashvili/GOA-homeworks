        The Exocoetidae are a family of marine ray-finned fish in the order
        Beloniformes, known colloquially as flying fish or flying cod. About 64
        species are grouped in seven genera. While they cannot fly in the same
        way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out
        of the water where their long wing-like fins enable gliding for
        considerable distances above the water's surface. The main reason for
        this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater
        predators,[3][4][5] which include swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin,
        among others,[6] though their periods of flight expose them to attack by
        avian predators such as frigate birds.

      <p>
        Barbados is known as "the land of the flying fish" and the fish is one
        of the national symbols of the country. The Exocet missile is named
        after them, as variants are launched from underwater, and take a low
        trajectory, skimming the surface, before striking their targets.

        The term Exocoetidae is both the scientific name and the general name in
        Latin for a flying fish. The suffix -idae, common for indicating a
        family, follows the root of the Latin word exocoetus, a transliteration
        of the Ancient Greek name ἐξώκοιτος. This means literally 'sleeping
        outside', from ἔξω, 'outside', and κοῖτος, 'bed', 'resting place', with
        the verb root κει-, 'to lie down' (not 'untruth'),[7] so named as flying
        fish were believed to leave the water to sleep ashore,[8] or due to
        flying fish flying and thus stranding themselves in boats.

        Flying fish live in all of the oceans, particularly in tropical and warm
        subtropical waters. They are commonly found in the epipelagic zone, the
        top layer of the ocean to a depth of about 200 m (660 ft).
      </p>

      <p>
        Numerous morphological features give flying fish the ability to leap
        above the surface of the ocean. One such feature is fully broadened
        neural arches, which act as insertion sites for connective tissues and
        ligaments in a fish's skeleton. Fully broadened neural arches act as
        more stable and sturdier sites for these connections, creating a strong
        link between the vertebral column and cranium.[11] A steady glide will
        improve their flight duration and allow them to be above water. An
        unsteady glide will not impact their flight as much but will shorten
        their flight duration not much more than a steady flight. This also will
        vary based on their energy consumption.[12] This ultimately allows a
        rigid and sturdy vertebral column (body) that is beneficial in flight.
        Having a rigid body during glided flight gives the flying fish
        aerodynamic advantages, increasing its speed and improving its aim.[11]
        Furthermore, flying fish have developed vertebral columns and ossified
        caudal complexes.[13] These features provide the majority of strength to
        the flying fish, allowing them to physically lift their bodies out of
        water and glide remarkable distances. These additions also reduce the
        flexibility of the flying fish, allowing them to perform powerful leaps
        without weakening midair.[13] At the end of a glide, they fold their
        pectoral fins to re-enter the sea, or drop their tails into the water to
        push against the water to lift for another glide, possibly changing
        direction.[14][15] The curved profile of the "wing" is comparable to the
        aerodynamic shape of a bird wing.[16] The fish is able to increase its
        time in the air by flying straight into or at an angle to the direction
        of updrafts created by a combination of air and ocean currents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Species of genus Exocoetus have one pair of fins and streamlined bodies
        to optimize for speed, while Cypselurus spp. have flattened bodies and
        two pairs of fins, which maximize their time in the air. From 1900 to
        the 1930s, flying fish were studied as possible models used to develop
        airplanes.

      <h3>Flight measurements</h3>

      <p>
        In May 2008, a Japanese television crew (NHK) filmed a flying fish
        (dubbed "Icarfish") off the coast of Yakushima Island, Japan. The fish
        spent 45 seconds in flight.[17] The previous record was 42 seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        he flights of flying fish are typically around 50 m (160 ft),[18] though
        they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances up
        to 400 m (1,300 ft).[18][19] They can travel at speeds of more than 70
        km/h (43 mph).[15] Maximum altitude is 6 m (20 ft) above the surface of
        the sea.[16] Flying fish often accidentally land on the decks of smaller
        vessels

        Flying fish are commercially fished in Japan, Vietnam, and China by
        gillnetting, and in Indonesia and India by dipnetting.[15] Often in
        Japanese cuisine, the fish is preserved by drying to be used as fish
        stock for dashi broth. The roe of Cheilopogon agoo, or Japanese flying
        fish, is used to make some types of sushi, and is known as tobiko. It is
        also a staple in the diet of the Tao people of Orchid Island, Taiwan.
        Flying fish is part of the national dish of Barbados, cou-cou and flying
        fish. The taste is close to that of a sardine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flying fish roe is known as "cau-cau" in southern Peru, and is used to
        make several local dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Solomon Islands, the fish are caught while they are flying, using
        nets held from outrigger canoes. They are attracted to the light of
        torches. Fishing is done only when no moonlight is available.

      <h3>Barbados</h3>
      <p>
        Barbados is known as "the land of the flying fish", and the fish is one
        of the national symbols of the country. Once abundant, it migrated
        between the warm, coral-filled Atlantic Ocean surrounding the island of
        Barbados and the plankton-rich outflows of the Orinoco River in
        Venezuela.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just after the completion of the Bridgetown Harbor / Deep Water Harbor
        in Bridgetown, Barbados had an increase of ship visits, linking the
        island to the world. The overall health of the coral reefs surrounding
        Barbados suffered due to ship-based pollution. Additionally, Barbadian
        overfishing pushed them closer to the Orinoco delta, no longer returning
        to Barbados in large numbers. Today, the flying fish only migrate as far
        north as Tobago, around 120 nmi (220 km; 140 mi) southwest of Barbados.
        Despite the change, flying fish remain a coveted delicacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many aspects of Barbadian culture center around the flying fish; it is
        depicted on coins, as sculptures in fountains, in artwork, and as part
        of the official logo of the Barbados Tourism Authority. Additionally,
        the Barbadian coat of arms features a pelican and dolphinfish on either
        side of the shield, but the dolphinfish resembles a flying fish.
        Furthermore, actual artistic renditions and holograms of the flying fish
        are also present within the Barbadian passport.
