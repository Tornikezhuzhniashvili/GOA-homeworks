        John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (/ˈruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/,[a] 3 January 1892 – 2
        September 1973) was an English writer and philologist. He was the author
        of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. From
        1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of
        Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of
        Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton
        Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton
        College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in
        1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the
        informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a
        Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28
        March 1972. After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a
        series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished
        manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit
        and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems,
        fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a
        fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. Between 1951 and
        1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these
        writings. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before
        Tolkien, the tremendous success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
        ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately
        precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors. As a result,
        he has been popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy
        literature and is widely regarded as one of the most influential authors
        of all time.

        Tolkien was English, and thought of himself as such.[3][T 1] His
        immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and
        sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien
        family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near
        Königsberg, which had been founded during the medieval German eastward
        expansion, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor, Michel Tolkien,
        was born around 1620.[4] Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746)
        was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg.[4] His son, Christian Tolkien
        (1706–1791), moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons
        Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John)
        Benjamin Tolkien (1752–1819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became
        the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R.
        Tolkien's second great-grandfather.[4] In 1792, John Benjamin Tolkien
        and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London,
        which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell &
        Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John
        Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German
        relatives joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the
        surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same
        family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them
        are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end
        of World War II.[5][4][6] According to Ryszard Derdziński, the surname
        Tolkien is of Low Prussian origin and probably means "son/descendant of
        Tolk".[5][4] Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the
        German word tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy",[7] and jokingly inserted
        himself as a "cameo" into The Notion Club Papers under the literally
        translated name Rashbold.[8] However, Derdziński has demonstrated this
        to be a false etymology. While J. R. R. Tolkien was aware of his
        family's German origin, his knowledge of the family's history was
        limited because he was "early isolated from the family of his
        prematurely deceased father".[5][4]

        John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in
        the Orange Free State (later annexed by the British Empire; now Free
        State Province in the Republic of South Africa), to Arthur Reuel Tolkien
        (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield
        (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to
        head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked.
        Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel
        Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.[9] As a child, Tolkien was
        bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to
        have been later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual
        memory of the event as an adult. In an earlier incident from Tolkien's
        infancy, a young family servant took the baby to his homestead,
        returning him the next morning.[10] When he was three, he went to
        England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy
        family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic
        fever before he could join them.[11] This left the family without an
        income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings
        Heath,[12] Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now
        in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to
        Birmingham.[13] He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and
        the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in
        his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove,
        Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag
        End, the name of which he used in his fiction.[14] Mabel Tolkien taught
        her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a
        keen pupil.[15] She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in
        him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to
        draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those
        concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin
        very early.[16] Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write
        fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He
        disliked Treasure Island and "The Pied Piper" and thought Alice's
        Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was "amusing but disturbing".
        He liked stories about "Red Indians" (the term then used for Native
        Americans in adventure stories[17]) and works of fantasy by George
        MacDonald.[18] In addition, the "Fairy Books" of Andrew Lang were
        particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of
        his later writings.[19]

        Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900
        despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,[20] which stopped all
        financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J. R. R. Tolkien was 12, his
        mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was
        renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person
        with diabetes mellitus type 1 could survive without treatment—insulin
        would not be discovered until 1921, two decades later. Nine years after
        her death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and
        it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts
        as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself
        with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."[20] Before her
        death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her
        close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory,
        who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics.[21] In a 1965
        letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man
        whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was an upper-class
        Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He
        was—and he was not. I first learned charity and forgiveness from him;
        and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which
        I came, knowing more about 'Bloody Mary' than the Mother of Jesus—who
        was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the
        Romanists."[T 2] After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the
        Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward's School,
        Birmingham, and later St Philip's School. In 1903, he won a Foundation
        Scholarship and returned to King Edward's.[22]

        While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a
        constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and
        Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon.
        Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others,
        including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language
        called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with,
        Naffarin, would be his own creation.[24][25] Tolkien learned Esperanto
        some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed "The Book of the
        Foxrook", a sixteen-page notebook, where the "earliest example of one of
        his invented alphabets" appears.[26] Short texts in this notebook are
        written in Esperanto.[27] In 1911, while they were at King Edward's
        School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith, and
        Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the
        T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding
        to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school
        and, secretly, in the school library.[28][29] After leaving school, the
        members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a council in
        London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a
        strong dedication to writing poetry.[30] In 1911, Tolkien went on a
        summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollected vividly in a
        1968 letter,[T 3] noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains
        ("including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine
        woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked
        from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines beyond
        Mürren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at
        leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, "the
        Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams". They went across the Kleine
        Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to
        Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass, through the upper
        Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.[31] In October
        of the same year, Tolkien began studying at Exeter College, Oxford. He
        initially read classics but changed his course in 1913 to English
        language and literature, graduating in 1915 with first-class
        honours.[32] Among his tutors at Oxford was Joseph Wright, whose Primer
        of the Gothic Language had inspired Tolkien as a schoolboy.[33]

        At the age of 16, Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his
        senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house
        where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. According to Humphrey
        Carpenter, "Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops,
        especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they
        would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to
        the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of
        their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to
        flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that
        they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they
        decided that they were in love."[34] His guardian, Father Morgan,
        considered it "altogether unfortunate"[T 4] that his surrogate son was
        romantically involved with an older, Protestant woman; Tolkien wrote
        that the combined tensions contributed to his having "muffed [his]
        exams".[T 4] Morgan prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even
        corresponding with Edith until he was 21. Tolkien obeyed this
        prohibition to the letter,[35] with one notable early exception, over
        which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he
        did not stop.[36] On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to
        Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at Cheltenham. He
        declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry
        him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George
        Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. But Edith said
        she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt "on the shelf" and
        had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that,
        because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.[37] On 8 January
        1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the
        platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a
        railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to
        accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her
        engagement ring. Field was "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field
        family was "insulted and angry".[37] Upon learning of Edith's new plans,
        Jessop wrote to her guardian, "I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he
        is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and
        when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted
        a profession it would have been different."[38] Following their
        engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to
        Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, "like many others of his
        age and class ... strongly anti-Catholic", was infuriated, and he
        ordered Edith to find other lodgings.[39] Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien
        were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at St
        Mary Immaculate Catholic Church at Warwick, on 22 March 1916.[40] In his
        1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's
        willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects
        except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.[T 4]

        In August 1914, Britain entered the First World War. Tolkien's relatives
        were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the
        British Army. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: "In
        those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty
        cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little
        physical courage."[T 4] Instead, Tolkien, "endured the obloquy",[T 4]
        and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing
        his degree. By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien
        recalled that the hints were "becoming outspoken from relatives".[T 4]
        He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire
        Fusiliers on 15 July 1915.[41][42] He trained with the 13th (Reserve)
        Battalion on Cannock Chase, Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley, Staffordshire,
        for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: "Gentlemen are
        rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed."[43]
        Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings
        near the training camp.[41] On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram
        summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent
        the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in
        Edgbaston, Birmingham.[44] He later wrote: "Junior officers were being
        killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then ... it was like
        a death."[45]

        On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight
        voyage to Calais. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he
        was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's base depot at Étaples. On
        7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer
        to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was
        part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division. While waiting to be summoned to
        his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a
        poem titled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by his feelings during
        the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal
        censorship, he developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his
        movements.[46] He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion
        at Rubempré, near Amiens.[47] He found himself commanding enlisted men
        who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of
        Lancashire.[48] According to John Garth, he "felt an affinity for these
        working class men", but military protocol prohibited friendships with
        "other ranks". Instead, he was required to "take charge of them,
        discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If
        possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty."[49]
        Tolkien later lamented, "The most improper job of any man ... is bossing
        other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those
        who seek the opportunity."[49]
