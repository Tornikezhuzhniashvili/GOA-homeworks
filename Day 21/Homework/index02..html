        Life of Pi is a Canadian philosophical novel by Yann Martel published in
        2001. The protagonist is Piscine Molitor "Pi" Patel, an Indian boy from
        Pondicherry, India, who explores issues of spirituality and metaphysics
        from an early age. After a shipwreck, he survives 227 days while
        stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger, raising
        questions about the nature of reality and how it is perceived and told.
        The novel has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.[1] It was
        rejected by at least five London publishing houses[2] before being
        accepted by Knopf Canada, which published it in September 2001. Martel
        won the Man Booker Prize the following year.[3][4][5] It was also chosen
        for CBC Radio's Canada Reads 2003, where it was championed by author
        Nancy Lee.[6] The French translation L'Histoire de Pi was chosen in the
        French CBC version of the contest Le Combat des livres, where it was
        championed by Louise Forestier.[7] The novel won the 2003 Boeke Prize, a
        South African novel award. In 2004, it won the Asian/Pacific American
        Award for Literature in Best Adult Fiction for years 2001â€“2003.[8] In
        2012 it was adapted into a feature film directed by Ang Lee with a
        screenplay by David Magee. In 2022, the novel was included on the "Big
        Jubilee Read" list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to
        celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.[9]

        The book begins with a note from the author, which is an integral part
        of the novel. Unusually, the note describes mostly fictional events. It
        serves to establish and enforce one of the book's main themes: the
        relativity of truth.

        In the 1960s, the narrator, Piscine Molitor "Pi" Patel, grows up as the
        son of the manager of a zoo in Pondicherry. While later recounting his
        life there, he offers insight on the antagonism of zoos and expresses
        his thoughts on why animals react less negatively than proponents of the
        idea suggest. The narrator describes how he acquired his full name as a
        tribute to the swimming pool in France. After schoolmates tease him by
        transforming his first name into "Pissing", he establishes the short
        form of his name as "Pi" when he starts secondary school. The name, he
        says, pays tribute to the transcendental number which is the ratio of
        the circumference of a circle to its diameter. In recounting his
        experiences, Pi describes several other unusual situations involving
        proper names: two visitors to the zoo, one a devout Muslim, and the
        other a committed atheist, bear identical names; and a 450-pound
        (200-kilogram) Bengal tiger at the zoo bears the name Richard Parker as
        the result of a clerical error which switched the tiger's name with the
        name of his human captor.[10] One day, Pi and his older brother Ravi are
        given an impromptu lesson on the dangers of the animals kept at the zoo.
        It opens with a goat being fed to another tiger, followed by a family
        tour of the zoo, during which his father explains the aggressive
        biological features of each animal. Pi is raised as a Hindu and
        practices vegetarianism. At the age of fourteen, he investigates
        Christianity and Islam, and decides to become an adherent of all three
        religions, much to his parents' dismay (and his religious mentors'
        frustration), saying he "just wants to love God".[11] He tries to
        understand God through the lens of each religion, and comes to recognize
        benefits in each. A few years later in February 1976, during the period
        when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declares "The Emergency", Pi's
        father decides to sell the zoo and emigrate with his wife and sons to
        Canada.

        The second part of the novel begins in July 1977 with Pi's family aboard
        the Tsimtsum, a Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from
        their zoo to North America. A few days out of port from Manila, the ship
        encounters a storm and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat,
        only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena, an injured
        Grant's zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. Much to the boy's
        distress, the hyena kills the zebra and then Orange Juice. A tiger has
        been hiding under the boat's tarpaulin: it is Richard Parker, who had
        boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself sometime
        before the hyena attack. Suddenly emerging from his hideaway, Richard
        Parker kills and eats the hyena. Frightened, Pi constructs a small raft
        out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the bow of the boat, and
        makes it his place of retirement. He begins conditioning Richard Parker
        to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and
        seasickness as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for
        signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal and is eventually
        able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting in the end
        that Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal. Pi
        recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean. At his lowest
        point, exposure renders him blind and unable to catch fish. Sometime
        later, Pi's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae
        inhabited by hundreds of thousands of meerkats. Soon, Pi and Richard
        Parker regain strength, but the boy's discovery of the carnivorous
        nature of the island's plant life forces him to return to the ocean. Two
        hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship's sinking, the lifeboat
        washes onto a beach in Mexico, after which Richard Parker disappears
        into the nearby jungle without looking back, leaving Pi heartbroken at
        the abrupt departure without even a farewell.

        Richard Parker and shipwreck narratives
      </h3>
      <p>
        The name Richard Parker for the tiger was inspired by a character in
        Edgar Allan Poe's nautical adventure novel The Narrative of Arthur
        Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838). Richard Parker is a mutineer who is
        stranded and eventually cannibalized on the hull of an overturned ship,
        and there is a dog aboard who is named Tiger. Martel also had another
        occurrence in mind in the famous legal case R v Dudley and Stephens
        (1884), where a shipwreck again results in the cannibalism of a cabin
        boy named Richard Parker, this time in a lifeboat.[14] A third Richard
        Parker drowned in the sinking of the Francis Spaight in 1846, with a
        cabin boy cannibalized during an incident involving the same ship in
        1835.[15] "So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something",
        Martel suggested.[16][17]

      <h2 id="Moacyr Scliar" >Moacyr Scliar</h2>
      <p>
        Martel has mentioned that a book review of Brazilian author Moacyr
        Scliar's 1981 novella Max and the Cats accounts in part for his novel's
        premise. Scliar's story describes a Jewish German refugee crossing the
        Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat.[18][19] Scliar said that he
        was perplexed that Martel "used the idea without consulting or even
        informing me," and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before
        deciding whether to take any action in response.[20][21] After talking
        with Martel, Scliar elected not to pursue the matter.[22] A dedication
        to Scliar "for the spark of life" appears in the author's note of Life
        of Pi. Literary reviews have described the similarities as superficial
        between Life of Pi and Max and the Cats. Reviewer Peter Yan wrote:
        "Reading the two books side-by-side, one realizes how inadequate bald
        plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each
        book,"[23] and noted that Martel's distinctive narrative structure is
        not found in Scliar's novella. The themes of the books are also
        dissimilar, with Max and the Cats being a metaphor for Nazism.[24] In
        Life of Pi, 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi's experience in the
        lifeboat, compared to 17 of 99 pages in Max and the Cats depicting time
        spent in a lifeboat.[24]
