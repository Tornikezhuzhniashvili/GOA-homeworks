        Exercise is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and
        overall health. It is performed for various reasons, including weight loss
        or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and
        the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, improve health, or simply
        for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can
        congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental
        health. In terms of health benefits, usually, 2.5 hours of
        moderate-intensity exercise per week is recommended for reducing the risk
        of health problems. At the same time, even doing a small amount of
        exercise is healthier than doing none. Only doing an hour and a quarter
        (11 minutes/day) of exercise could reduce the risk of early death,
        cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.

    <p>
      Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on
      the overall effect they have on the human body.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups
        and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting. The
        goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance.
        Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk
        walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis,
        continuous training, and long distance running.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can
        firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone
        density, balance, and coordination. Examples of strength exercises are
        push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also
        includes weight training, functional training, Eccentric Training,
        interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which
        increase short-term muscle strength.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles. Activities such as
        stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber.
        The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance
        of injury.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy,
      agility, power, and speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. 'Dynamic'
      exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the
      diastolic blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow.
      Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the
      systolic pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the
      performance of the exercise.

    <h1><strong>Health effects</strong></h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can
      contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, regulating the digestive
      system, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength,
      and joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical
      risks, and strengthening the immune system. Some studies indicate that
      exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life.
      People who participate in moderate to high levels of physical exercise
      have a lower mortality rate compared to individuals who by comparison are
      not physically active. Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated
      with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential. The majority of
      the benefits from exercise are achieved with around 3500 metabolic
      equivalent (MET) minutes per week, with diminishing returns at higher
      levels of activity. For example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15
      minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20 minutes, and walking or
      bicycling for transportation 25 minutes on a daily basis would together
      achieve about 3000 MET minutes a week. A lack of physical activity causes
      approximately 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7%
      of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer, and 10% of colon cancer
      worldwide. Overall, physical inactivity causes 9% of premature mortality
      worldwide. The American-British writer Bill Bryson wrote: "If someone
      invented a pill that could do for us all that a moderate amount of
      exercise achieves, it would instantly become the most successful drug in
      history.

    <section id="Fitness">
    <h2><strong>Fitness</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Most people can increase fitness by increasing physical activity levels.
      Increases in muscle size from resistance training are primarily determined
      by diet and testosterone. This genetic variation in improvement from
      training is one of the key physiological differences between elite
      athletes and the larger population. There is evidence that exercising in
      middle age may lead to better physical ability later in life. Early motor
      skills and development is also related to physical activity and
      performance later in life. Children who are more proficient with motor
      skills early on are more inclined to be physically active, and thus tend
      to perform well in sports and have better fitness levels. Early motor
      proficiency has a positive correlation to childhood physical activity and
      fitness levels, while less proficiency in motor skills results in a more
      sedentary lifestyle. The type and intensity of physical activity performed
      may have an effect on a person's fitness level. There is some weak
      evidence that high-intensity interval training may improve a person's VO2
      max slightly more than lower intensity endurance training. However,
      unscientific fitness methods could lead to sports injuries.

    <section id="Cardiovascular system">
    <h2><strong>Cardiovascular system</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The beneficial effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system is well
      documented. There is a direct correlation between physical inactivity and
      cardiovascular disease, and physical inactivity is an independent risk
      factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Low levels of
      physical exercise increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases mortality.
      Children who participate in physical exercise experience greater loss of
      body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness. Studies have shown that
      academic stress in youth increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in
      later years; however, these risks can be greatly decreased with regular
      physical exercise. There is a dose-response relationship between the
      amount of exercise performed from approximately 700–2000 kcal of energy
      expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease
      mortality in middle-aged and elderly men. The greatest potential for
      reduced mortality is seen in sedentary individuals who become moderately
      active. Studies have shown that since heart disease is the leading cause
      of death in women, regular exercise in aging women leads to healthier
      cardiovascular profiles. The most beneficial effects of physical activity
      on cardiovascular disease mortality can be attained through
      moderate-intensity activity (40–60% of maximal oxygen uptake, depending on
      age). After a myocardial infarction, survivors who changed their lifestyle
      to include regular exercise had higher survival rates. Sedentary people
      are most at risk for mortality from cardiovascular and all other causes.
      According to the American Heart Association, exercise reduces the risk of
      cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke. Some have
      suggested that increases in physical exercise might decrease healthcare
      costs, increase the rate of job attendance, as well as increase the amount
      of effort women put into their jobs.
