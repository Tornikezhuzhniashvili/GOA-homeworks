        Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are
        predominantly photosynthetic. This means that they obtain their energy
        from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with
        cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the
        green pigment chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have
        lost the genes for chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and obtain their
        energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants are multicellular, except
        for some green algae. Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant
        kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and
        included algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since then; current
        definitions exclude the fungi and some of the algae. By the definition
        used in this article, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (green
        plants), which consists of the green algae and the embryophytes or land
        plants (hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, conifers and
        other gymnosperms, and flowering plants). A definition based on genomes
        includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae and the
        glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida. There are about 380,000 known
        species of plants, of which the majority, some 260,000, produce seeds.
        They range in size from single cells to the tallest trees. Green plants
        provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen; the
        sugars they create supply the energy for most of Earth's ecosystems, and
        other organisms, including animals, either eat plants directly or rely
        on organisms which do so. Grain, fruit, and vegetables are basic human
        foods and have been domesticated for millennia. People use plants for
        many purposes, such as building materials, ornaments, writing materials,
        and, in great variety, for medicines. The scientific study of plants is
        known as botany, a branch of biology.

      <p>All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification dates from Aristotle (384–322 BC), who distinguished different levels of beings in his biology,[5] based on whether living things had a "sensitive soul" or like plants only a "vegetative soul".[6] Theophrastus, Aristotle's student, continued his work in plant taxonomy and classification.[7] Much later, Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of the modern system of scientific classification, but retained the animal and plant kingdoms, naming the plant kingdom the Vegetabilia.[7]</p>
