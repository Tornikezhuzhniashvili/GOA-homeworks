        Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological
        kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few exceptions, animals
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to
        move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells,
        the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade,
        meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million
        living animal species have been described, of which around 1.05 million
        are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are
        vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million
        animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033
        in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions
        with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The
        scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal
        behaviour is known as ethology. The animal kingdom is divided into five
        infrakingdoms/superphyla, namely Porifera, Ctenophora, Placozoa,
        Cnidaria and Bilateria. Most living animal species belong to the
        infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members have
        a bilaterally symmetric and significantly cephalised body plan, and the
        vast majority of bilaterians belong to two large superphyla: the
        protostomes, which includes organisms such as arthropods, molluscs,
        flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include
        echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains
        the vertebrates. The much smaller basal phylum Xenacoelomorpha have an
        uncertain position within Bilateria. Animals first appear in the fossil
        record in the late Cryogenian period and diversified in the subsequent
        Ediacaran period in what is known as the Avalon explosion. Earlier
        evidence of animals is still controversial; the sponge-like organism
        Otavia has been dated back to the Tonian period at the start of the
        Neoproterozoic, but its identity as an animal is heavily contested.[5]
        Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil
        record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began
        around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most classes during the
        Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. 6,331 groups of genes common to all
        living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single
        common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the Cryogenian period.
        Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those
        without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological
        classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which
        Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst
        Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now
        synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no
        longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological
        classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as
        molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the
        evolutionary relationships between taxa. Humans make use of many other
        animal species for food (including meat, eggs, and dairy products), for
        materials (such as leather, fur, and wool), as pets and as working
        animals for transportation, and services. Dogs, the first domesticated
        animal, have been used in hunting, in security and in warfare, as have
        horses, pigeons and birds of prey; while other terrestrial and aquatic
        animals are hunted for sports, trophies or profits. Non-human animals
        are also an important cultural element of human evolution, having
        appeared in cave arts and totems since the earliest times, and are
        frequently featured in mythology, religion, arts, literature, heraldry,
        politics, and sports.

      <p class="p-2">
        The word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning,
        which is itself derived from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul'.[6]
        The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom
        Animalia.[7] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer
        only to nonhuman animals.[8][9][10][11] The term metazoa is derived from
        Ancient Greek μετα meta 'after' (in biology, the prefix meta- stands for
        'later') and ζῷᾰ zōia 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal'.[12][13]

      <p>Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular.[14] Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients,[15] animals are heterotrophic,[16][17] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.[18] With very few exceptions, animals respire aerobically.[a][20] All animals are motile[21] (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.[22]</p>
