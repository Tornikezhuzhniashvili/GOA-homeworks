      <h1 class="h-1">Belgian cuisine</h1>
      <hr />
      <p class="p-1">
        Belgian cuisine is widely varied among regions, while also reflecting
        the cuisines of neighbouring France, Germany and the Netherlands. It is
        characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the more hearty
        Flemish fare. Outside the country, Belgium is best known for its
        chocolate, waffles, fries and beer. Though Belgium has many distinctive
        national dishes, many internationally popular foods like hamburgers and
        spaghetti bolognese are also popular in Belgium, and most of what
        Belgians eat is also eaten in neighbouring countries. "Belgian cuisine"
        therefore usually refers to dishes of Belgian origin, or those
        considered typically Belgian. Belgian cuisine traditionally prizes
        regional and seasonal ingredients. Ingredients typical in Belgian dishes
        include potatoes, leeks, grey shrimp, white asparagus, Belgian endive,
        horse meat and local beer, in addition to common European staples
        including meat, cheese and butter. Belgians typically eat four meals a
        day, with a light breakfast, medium lunch, a snack, and a large dinner.
        Belgium has a plethora of local dishes and products. Examples include
        waterzooi from Ghent, couque biscuit from the town of Dinant, and tarte
        au riz from Verviers. While their local origins are acknowledged, most
        such dishes are enjoyed throughout Belgium.

      <p class="p-2">
        Little is known about early Belgian cuisine. It can only be assumed that
        it was similar to that of other early European tribes. The ancient
        Belgians probably kept animals like sheep and cattle, grew root
        vegetables, hunted for animals such as the wild boar, fished, and
        foraged for berries and herbs. Beer was brewed as well, although not
        with hops (a later discovery). The transition from appropriation to
        agriculture is thought to have occurred around 2000 BC, with migrants
        travelling across the continent along the Danube and Rhine rivers.
        Small, cultivated plots of land grew primitive varieties of wheat (e.g.
        emmer and einkorn), barley, and legumes (e.g. lentils and peas). Goats
        were bred for dairy products, sheep provided wool, and pigs provided
        meat. Wealthier families regularly ate meat, while the poor subsisted
        primarily on legumes, milk, and cereals in the form of porridge or
        bread.[1] The Celtic tribes of the Belgae, who settled in Belgium around
        300 BC, brought with them not only the wheeled plough and three-field
        crop rotation, but also enriched the diet with poultry (e.g. chicken and
        geese), mead and hops beer. Salt-cured beef was exported from the
        British Isles to the continent.[2]
