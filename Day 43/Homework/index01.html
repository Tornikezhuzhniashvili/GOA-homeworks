        The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed,
        hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of
        two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the
        past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus,
        into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating
        horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been
        widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
        domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as
        feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which
        are horses that never have been domesticated. There is an extensive,
        specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts,
        covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings,
        breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses are adapted to run, allowing
        them to quickly escape predators, and possess a good sense of balance
        and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from
        predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both
        standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep
        significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares, carry
        their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a
        foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated
        horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of
        two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an
        average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely
        divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited
        "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft
        horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods",
        developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often
        focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly
        in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today,
        developed for many different uses. Horses and humans interact in a wide
        variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits
        as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture,
        entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare,
        from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed,
        using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many
        products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair,
        bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.

        Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic
        horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.[7] Uncommonly, a few
        animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.[8] The oldest
        verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to
        the age of 62.[7] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in
        Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007
        at age 56.[9] Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for
        most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of
        each year in the Northern Hemisphere[7][10] and each August 1 in the
        Southern Hemisphere.[11] The exception is in endurance riding, where the
        minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.[12]
