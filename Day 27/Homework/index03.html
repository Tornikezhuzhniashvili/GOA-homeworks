      Li Lianjie (courtesy name Yangzhong; born 26 April 1963),[2] better known
      by his stage name Jet Li, is a Chinese-born Singaporean martial artist,
      actor, and philanthropist. After three years of training with acclaimed
      wushu teacher Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the
      Beijing Wushu Team in 1974, winning the first of five men's national
      championships.[3] After his retirement from the sport in 1979, he went on
      to win great acclaim as an actor, making his debut with the Chinese-Hong
      Kong martial arts film Shaolin Temple (1982), which instantly catapulted
      him to stardom in East Asia.[4] Though continued success followed after
      two sequels in 1984 and 1986, Li had a major breakthrough across Asia with
      the Once Upon a Time in China film series (1991â€“1993), in which he
      portrayed Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung. He starred in his directorial
      debut film Born to Defence (1986), which saw Li, for the first time,
      playing a character in a period setting. Many of his 1990s martial arts
      films are regarded as classics of the genre, particularly Swordsman II
      (1992), Fong Sai-yuk (1993), and Fist of Legend (1994).[5] Before
      transitioning to Hollywood in the late 1990s, he appeared in several
      contemporary Hong Kong action films which fused guns and kung fu, most
      notably High Risk (1995), Black Mask (1996), and Hitman (1998).[6] His
      movie career in China is credited with reviving wushu in Hong Kong martial
      arts films during the 1990s,[3] and revitalising the Shaolin Temple.[7] Li
      is also noted for his contribution to making new wuxia films popular
      internationally during his career.[4] Li made his Hollywood debut as a
      villain in the 1998 buddy cop action film Lethal Weapon 4. His first
      leading role in a Hollywood film was as Han Sing in Romeo Must Die (2000).
      He went on to star in many international action films, including in French
      cinema with the Luc Besson-produced films Kiss of the Dragon (2001) and
      Unleashed (2005). In 2008, he portrayed the title character villain in The
      Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and starred in the US-China
      co-production The Forbidden Kingdom, which marked his first collaboration
      with fellow martial arts star Jackie Chan. From 2010 to 2014, he appeared
      in the first three films in the ensemble action film series The
      Expendables. He continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, appearing in
      the critically acclaimed film Hero (2002), Fearless (2006), which marked
      his final wushu martial arts film, and The Warlords (2007). For the
      latter, he became the highest paid actor in a Chinese-language movie,
      previously holding the record for his part in Hero.[8] With a film career
      spanning more than forty years, Li is regarded as one of the most iconic
      Chinese film stars, one of the most renowned martial arts stars of his
      generation, and one of the greatest martial arts stars in the history of
      cinema.[9][10][11] In 2004, he topped Forbes list of China's richest
      stars.[12] As a philanthropist, he founded One Foundation in 2007, which
      was registered in 2011 as the first private charitable fundraising
      organization in China.[13][14][15][16] He also co-founded Taiji Zen, an
      online health and wellness program providing instruction in meditation and
      tai chi.[17][18] Li was named by Time as one of the 100 Most Influential
      People in 2010.[19]
